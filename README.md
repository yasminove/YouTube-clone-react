# YouTube Clone

YouTube Clone is a web app where a user can search for YouTube videos of interest and view them


## Prerequisites

- This project has dependencies installed via `npm`, which is a package manager for node. In order to view the project, you should have `node` installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- `live-server` should be installed globally on your machine. If you don't have it, open a new terminal window and run this command `npm install -g live-server`


## How To Run The Application Locally

### Clone the project
In you teminal, move to the directory where you want to keep this repository in. Then, clone this repository using this command:

        git clone https://github.com/yasminhillis/YouTube-clone-react.git


Then, cd into the repository using this command:

        cd YouTube-clone-react

Install the project depdencies:

        npm install


## Set up interactions with the YouTube API

  You'll need a developer key in order to access videos from the YouTube Data API. This is common practice with third party APIs because they want to keep track of who is accessing their data, enforce rate limits, and even sometimes make money. Access to the YouTube API is free, all you need is a Google Account.

  - [ ] Go to Google's YouTube API
  - [ ]  If prompted, select a project or create a new one. It doesn't matter what you name a new project

  - [ ] Click Enable and then Go to Credentials
  Select Web browser from the drop-down and the Public data radio button

  - [ ] Give your key any name, leave the optional field blank, and click Create.

  - [ ] Make your key available to the rest of your application from a new file, `src/config/youtube.js`

Now, run this command to build the project

        npm run build
      

In another terminal window by running `live-server`. If no new window is prompted in your browser, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to view the project.

### Next Steps:

I am planning to add a back-end for this project. Deployment is another crucial step to be taken as well. I want to use `redux` as well.
